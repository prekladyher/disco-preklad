#. Title = INVENTORY / FRACTURED BULLET
#. Description = By inspecting the bullet, you can find out that:
#. 1. The bullet came from a breech-loaded rifle.
#. 2. The bullet was shot from some distance, so this was probably not a mercy kill (white check.)
#. 3. The rifle used was a model mass-produced during the revolutionary war, and the surplus rifles/ammo are still a favourite with third-world guerrillas and Jamrock bangers.
#. Actor = You
#. Conversant = Fractured Bullet
